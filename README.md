Resident assistant duty day swap tool.

The RA swap tool makes the process of requesting a swap and getting it approved much eaiser. It uses Google Apps Script to integrate with Google Forms, Sheets, and Gmail, in order to:

1. Collect swap request
2. Store the request in a spreadsheet
3. Email the both the requester and the requested with a link to view the status of the swap
4. Email the Resident Director of the hall with a link to approve the swap once the requested RA approves it
5. Email the Senior RA with an option to update the duty calendar (Could integrate with Google Calendar to swap the dates automatically)
